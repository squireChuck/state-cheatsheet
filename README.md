# state-cheatsheet
## Intro
Small compilation of info related to U.S. states, e.g. sample addresses, driver's license formats, etc. Useful as a quick reference or for hitting the endpoints in your testing scripts/other personal work.

## Pre-req's
Node 4.6.0, npm

## Setup
1. Copy or clone project to computer.

2. Install the dependencies listed in package.json, e.g. in the command prompt, nav to state-cheatsheet/server and `npm install`

4. After that's done, stay in the same folder and run `node app.js`

5. Go to http://localhost:3000/app to view the quickie index.html I whipped up. If it loads, you're all set!
